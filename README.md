  ## Description
    The Coding Quiz is a project to help users learn more about coding by quizzing themselves on software development related questions. The use will go through the quiz and answer 5 questions, they will be timed starting from 75 seconds and will decrease as each second passes. The timer will also be reduced if the user incorrectly answers a question. This assignment gave practice of using JavaScript to create and remove html elements to show new screens. Also, the use of the high score gave practice of using local storage to be able to store data.
